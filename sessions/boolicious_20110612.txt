After Battle: With a plop!, Wensleydale hops onto the corpse of your foe, which begins to smoke and dissolve in a rather gruesome fashion. After a minute, the cheezling crawls back up onto your shoulder, burbling happily; it's much warmer than before, and as the heat spreads through your body, you feel much better. And kind of creeped out.
